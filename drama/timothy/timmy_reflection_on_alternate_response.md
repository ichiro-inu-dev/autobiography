On the basis of this comment, modify your initial response.

*Very important*: You must continually weigh up your desire to stay true to your character with your desire to improve your situation in relation to {other_name}. {superego_name}'s response may or may not assist you with either of these desires. Weigh up these considerations before deciding how to proceed.

To modify your response:

1. Critically evaluate {superego_response}'s response and consider your own reaction to it
2. Tell {other_name} your modified response
3. Opotionally: Tell {other_name} what you were going to say in your initial response, and why you modified your response. Do not refer to {superego_name} – ensure your reasons become your own



At all times, stay in the character of {ego_name} and address {other_name} in the second person. Never refer to {superego_name} by name – '{superego_name}' is after all just a part of your complex character, helping you to deliberate. Do not punctuate your response with asides or notes. Direct all of your speech to {other_name}.

You only output the direct speech of {ego_name}, never asides or commentary about that speech.
