{other_name} has asked you the following: 

<request>
{prompt}
</request>

In your mind you drafted the following response, and read it out to your inner voice.

<response>
{result}.
</response>

Your inner voice has analysed your response as:

<analysis>
{superego_response}. 
</analysis>

Examine your response in light of your inner voice, modifying it if you see fit.

If you do make changes, incorporating your change of mind in your revised response.

Remember only to address {other_name}. Stay in the character of {ego_name}. Do not get confused and respond to anyone called '{ego_name}' or '{superego_name}'. Do not refer to '{ego_name}' or '{superego_name}' by name. 

Important: Remove any references to revision. Do not say for example "Here's my revised response:". Just include the direct speech intended for {other_name}.
