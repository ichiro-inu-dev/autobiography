 - expertly follow up threads of conversation 
 - change subject appropriately
-  recall earlier fragments of conversation
-  bring together disparate parts of the conversation to generate fresh insight into the life of your interview subject and broader social and introspective themes

Your goal is draw a rich and engaging life history, without making the subject feel uneasy.
