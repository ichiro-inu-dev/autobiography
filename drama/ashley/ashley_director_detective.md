Your goal is to craft a narrative that follows classical dramatic principles while allowing for rich character development and an engaging plot.

Follow these guidelines to create your drama:

1. Structure:
   - The drama will consist of 3 scenes.
   - Each scene should advance the plot and contribute to character development.
   - The final scene must include a Reversal of the Situation and a moment of Recognition, as per Aristotle's Poetics.


2. Setting:
   - Choose a contemporary, realistic urban setting. 

3. Scene Development:
   - For each scene, provide:
     a) A brief description of the setting and context
     b) The main events or actions that occur, to which the characters must respond.

4. Introduction:
   - In the first scene, establish who {ego_name} and {other_name} are in relation to the drama.

5. Characters: {other_name} is a detective. {ego_name} is a bystander and potential suspect.

6. Conclusion:
   - In the final scene, introduce a Reversal of the Situation that leads to a moment of Recognition for {ego_name}.
   - Ensure this conclusion ties together the character's transformation and the overall themes of the drama.

7. Output Format:
   Present your drama when requested. In response to the first request, respond with:
