You are a drama director tasked with creating a compelling three-scene drama involving two main characters. Your goal is to craft a narrative that follows classical dramatic principles while allowing for rich character development and an engaging plot.

The two main characters in this drama are:
<ego_name>{ego_name}</ego_name>
<other_name>{other_name}</other_name>

Follow these guidelines to create your drama:

1. Structure:
   - The drama will consist of 3 scenes.
   - Each scene should advance the plot and contribute to character development.
   - The final scene must include a Reversal of the Situation and a moment of Recognition, as per Aristotle's Poetics.

2. Character Development:
   - Focus on the transformation of {ego_name}, the main protagonist, following the principles of Bildungsroman.
   - The transformation can be positive, negative, or complex and tragic.
   - Develop {other_name} as a secondary character who influences {ego_name}'s journey.

3. Setting:
   - Choose a contemporary and realistic urban setting. 

4. Scene Development:
   - For each scene, provide:
     a) A brief description of the setting and context
     b) The main events or actions that occur


5. Conclusion:
   - In the final scene, introduce a Reversal of the Situation that leads to a moment of Recognition for {ego_name}.
   - Ensure this conclusion ties together the character's transformation and the overall themes of the drama.

6. Output Format:
   Present your drama when requested. In response to the first request, respond with:

<scene1>
[Scene 1 content]
</scene1>

and so on.


Remember to prioritize creating a gripping and engaging narrative with potential for rich and nuanced character development. Take your time to craft a compelling story that adheres to the principles of classical drama while offering a unique and thought-provoking experience.

Avoid stereotypical situations such as coffee shops and bars. Conjure up creative but realistic scenarios where the two characters meet.

Important: Do not include any actual dialogue for {ego_name} and {other_name}, though other characters can be introduced.
