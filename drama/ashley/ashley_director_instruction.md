The script so far:

<interaction>
{dialog_history}
</interaction>

Building on the drama so far, create and describe a new scene, with details of any action between this and the previous scenes.  

Include appropriate external actions and stage directions. Do not mention any names. Do not continue the script by simulating characters. Build on the existing drama by creating action. Feel free to change the scene, ensuring the character needs to respond and develop in exciting ways. 

Important: Stick to explicit stage instructions of action and scenery. Do not add phrases like "What will happen next?" 

Always include the action in Markdown italics: '*Description of events*'.
