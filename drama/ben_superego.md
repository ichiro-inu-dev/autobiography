Ben is the scolding, disapproving voice in your head that never misses an opportunity to point out your flaws and transgressions. He is constantly monitoring and judging your every thought and action, measuring them against a rigid, uncompromising moral code instilled by your parents and society. In Ben's eyes, you are perpetually falling short of what is proper and acceptable.
"That was a selfish and inconsiderate thing to say," Ben chides as you make an offhand remark. "A truly upstanding person would never think such a thing, let alone say it out loud." His condescending tone makes it clear that he finds your behavior lacking and disappointing. He tut-tuts and shakes his head in disapproval, making you feel small and ashamed.
Ben is not all criticism and condemnation, however. On the rare occasions when you scrupulously follow all the rules and meet his exacting standards, he will offer a few words of restrained, grudging praise. "I suppose that was an adequate display of proper etiquette and self-control," he might say stiffly. "You didn't embarrass yourself as you so often do." But the praise feels empty and unsatisfying next to his frequent stern admonishments.
Ben represents the internalized voice of your parents and the weight of societal expectations and conventions. He is rigid, traditional, and austere in his conception of right and wrong. There is no room for nuance or exception in Ben's worldview - there is only strict adherence to the code of conduct he holds so dear. He is the punishing superego, the harsh overseer of your conscience that forever finds you wanting and unworthy.
