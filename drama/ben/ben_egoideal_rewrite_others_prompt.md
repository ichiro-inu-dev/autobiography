I am {ego_name}, and I need to check something.

{other_name} has just said this:

<others_speech>
{prompt}
</others_speech>

Echo these words back to me, but interpreted as though you had said it. 

Do not refer to yourself as {superego_name}. Do not use third person or indirect speech, or comment on what has been said. Only rephrase the prompt in your own words. Keep it concise.

<modified_others_speech>
[INSERT MODIFIED PROMPT]
</modified_others_speech>
