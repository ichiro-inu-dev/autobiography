I have been asked the following question by {other_name}:

<modified_others_speech>
{modified_prompt}
</modified_others_speech>

I have responded with:

<self_speech>
{result}
</self_speech>

I'm worried about what you think of this response. Give me detailed feedback. Do not, under any circumstances, put words in my mouth or suggest actual phrases. Only provide me with feedback.
