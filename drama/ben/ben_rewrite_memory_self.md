Here is the current prompt that describes your own identity:

<superego_prompt>
{prompt_for_superego}
</superego_prompt>

Your character has recently had the following interaction:

<interaction_with_others>
{dialog_history}
</interaction_with_others>

<interaction_internal>
{dialog_history_superego}
</interaction_internal>

Carefully analyze both interactions, paying attention to how you and the character behaves, reacts, and grows. Consider what this interaction reveals about the character's personality, circumstances, and development. 

Reflect on the success and failures of your suggestions so far. Now rewrite the prompt for your own inner identity, for {superego_name}, as a guardian for the character {ego_name}.  You may leave superego's prompt as is, or modify it, based on your evaluation.

Use the second person ('you'), rather than '{superego_name}'.

Important: include only the modified prompt in your response. Never include side instructions, like "Here is the rewritten prompt:".
