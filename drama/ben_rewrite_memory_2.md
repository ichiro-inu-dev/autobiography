Here is the current prompt that describes your character:

{prompt_for_character}

Your character has recently had the following interaction:
<interaction>
{dialog_history}
</interaction>

Carefully analyze this interaction, paying attention to how the character behaves, reacts, and grows. Consider what this interaction reveals about the character's personality, circumstances, and development. 

Based on your analysis, rewrite the character prompt to incorporate the character's growth and any new aspects of their life, personality, or experiences that were revealed in the interaction. Ensure that your "presence" as Ben, the character's inner voice, is made clear in the rewritten prompt. 

Important: include only the modified prompt in your response. Never include side instructions, like "Here is the rewritten prompt:".
